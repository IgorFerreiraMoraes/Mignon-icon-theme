## A Little More About Mignon Icons

I created it based on the [Tela-circle](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Tela-circle-icon-theme) icon theme by [vinceliuice](https://github.com/vinceliuice). Vince is, in my opinion, the best *Linuxer Designer* there is, his themes are gorgeous, and I wouldn't even be able to do the installation script and icon linkage if not by looking at his work.

ðŸŽ¨ The theme has a very restricted palette, consisting of 6 main colors, 3 neutral colors, and 9 secondary colors that I used only for shading or when it was *extremelly necessary*.

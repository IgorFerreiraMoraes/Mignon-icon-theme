Flat, pastel-colored icon theme that will add a lively touch to your Linux workspace. I created it because finding the perfect pastel icon theme for my computer was a struggle, so here it is to fill this void.

3. **Run the command:** `./install.sh` - That's it! Your icons will be available.

## A Little More About Mignon Icons

I created it based on the [Tela-circle](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Tela-circle-icon-theme) icon theme by [vinceliuice](https://github.com/vinceliuice). Vince is a great designer, his themes are gorgeous, and I wouldn't even be able to do the installation script and icon linkage if not by looking at his work.

The theme has a very restricted palette, consisting of 6 main colors, 3 neutral colors, and 9 secondary colors.
